# New Feature

Creates a new feature end-to-end: product definition, technical design, implementation, and contract validation. Use this when the feature doesn't exist in the codebase yet.

## Input

The user describes what they want to build. Can be vague ("I need follow-up reminders") or specific ("A scheduled message system that sends WhatsApp messages N hours after a conversation ends").

## Workflow

### 0. Load Project Context

If `_ctx/index.md` exists, read it first. This is the big-picture map of the entire project — domain glossary, services, flows, and dependencies. Use it to inform your understanding of where the new feature fits, which services are involved, and what patterns already exist. This avoids redundant exploration in later steps.

### 1. Understand the Feature

Start a conversation to understand what the user wants. Ask about:

- What does it do? (the core behavior in one sentence)
- Who triggers it? (user action, cron, event, API call)
- What's the expected outcome? (message sent, data stored, UI updated)
- What are the main use cases? (happy paths)
- What's out of scope? (boundaries)

Keep it short. Don't interrogate — 2-3 questions max per round, stop when you have enough to write a first draft.

### 2. Create Feature Directory

Pick a kebab-case name for the feature. Confirm with the user.

Create `_ctx/{feature}/` and copy the three template files from `_ctx/_template/`.

### 3. Write product.md

From the conversation, write `product.md`. Follow the template — keep it minimal:

- Overview: 1-2 sentences
- Use cases: one line each
- Business rules: plain language
- Out of scope: plain language

Show it to the user. Iterate until they confirm. Write the file.

### 4. Design engineering.md

Now look at the existing codebase to inform the technical design. **Use an agent to explore the repos** — spawn a single agent to search across all repos for relevant patterns, interfaces, and conventions:

- List directories at the workspace root (skip `_ctx/`) to understand what services exist
- Look at similar features to understand patterns, conventions, and how services communicate
- Identify which repos will need changes for the new feature
- Understand existing interfaces the new feature needs to integrate with

Then design the engineering contract with the user:

- Where does this feature live? (new service, existing service, multiple)
- What interfaces does it expose? (APIs, events, queues)
- What existing interfaces does it consume?
- What constraints apply?

Write `engineering.md`. Keep it minimal — only the contracts that matter. Show to user, iterate, write.

### 5. Implement

Use the contract-reviewer agent definition (if available) and implement the feature respecting the contracts defined in `product.md` and `engineering.md`.

**Use an agent for implementation** — when changes span multiple repos, spawn a single agent that has the full product and engineering context to implement across all affected repos.

If the feature is large, break it into multiple chunks — one per use case or logical piece. After each chunk, review before continuing.

### 6. Validate

After implementation, spawn the **contract-reviewer agent** (`ctx:contract-reviewer`) with:
- The feature name
- The scope: the list of files that were created or modified

The contract-reviewer will check the changes against both product and engineering contracts and report violations, warnings, and implementation drift suggestions.

If violations are found: fix them before proceeding.

### 7. Write implementation.md

Now that the code exists, write `implementation.md` describing what was just built:

- Key files created, organized by repo
- Flows for each use case
- Data model if any was created
- Known limitations (first version, so there will be some)
- Recent changes: today's date + "Initial implementation"

### 8. Handoff

Do NOT commit. Leave everything for the developer to review.

Provide a summary:
- What was designed (product + engineering decisions)
- What was implemented (files created/modified)
- Contract review result
- Any open questions or suggestions for next steps

The developer decides when and how to commit.
